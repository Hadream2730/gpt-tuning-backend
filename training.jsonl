The rope is stretched, endpoints separated by length \\( 4a \\).\n\n  - Particle 1 position coordinate: Let's place it at \\( x=0 \\).\n\n  - Particle 2 position coordinate: \\( x=4a \\) along one axis.\n\n  - Both moving with velocity in the \\( y \\)-direction, say upwards.\n\n- **Pin introduced:**\n\n  - Pin is fixed at position \\( x = a \\), which is \\( a \\) away from particle 1.\n\n  - Rope passes through pin, dividing the rope into two segments: Particles 1 to pin and pin to Particle 2.\n\n  - Particle 1 is initially at distance \\( a \\) from the pin.\n\n- **After introducing pin:**\n\n  - Particles rotate around the pin in opposite directions.\n\n  - The rope length \\( 4a \\) constant, split into two variable lengths: \\( r_1 \\) (distance Particle 1 to pin), and \\( r_2 \\) (distance Particle 2 to pin).\n\n  - Constraint: \\( r_1 + r_2 = 4a \\).\n\n- **During rotation:**\n\n  - Both particles move on circular paths with radii \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) respectively, about the pin.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: List Given Variables and Conditions\n\n| Variable          | Meaning                                    | Given / Known                    |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| \\( m \\)           | Mass of each particle                       | Given                          |\n| \\( a \\)           | Reference length                            | Given                          |\n| \\( 4a \\)          | Length of the inextensible rope             | Given                          |\n| \\( v \\)           | Initial velocity of each particle           | Given                          |\n| \\( r_1 \\)         | Distance of particle 1 from the pin          | Dynamic variable                |\n| \\( r_2 \\)         | Distance of particle 2 from the pin          | Dynamic variable                |\n| \\( r_1 + r_2 = 4a \\) | Rope length constraint                       | Must hold at all times          |\n| \\( R_1 = r_1 \\)   | Radius of circular motion of particle 1     | Dynamic                        |\n| \\( R_2 = r_2 \\)   | Radius of circular motion of particle 2     | Dynamic                        |\n| \\( \\theta_1 \\), \\( \\theta_2 \\) | Angular positions of the particles about the pin | Dynamic                         |\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Break Into Manageable Sub Steps\nWe want to find the maximum \\( r_1 \\).\n\n- First, consider the initial motion, calculate system properties: velocities, angular momentum, energy.\n- Second, examine conservation laws applicable after pin introduction.\n- Third, apply constraints and conservation laws to relate \\( r_1 \\) and other physical quantities.\n- Fourth, find \\( r_1^{max} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Check Several Principles\n\n- **Angular momentum about the pin:**\n\n  - Forces acting on each particle are along the rope segments (tension forces), directed radially toward the pin.\n\n  - Since tension forces do not produce torque about the pin (as shown earlier), **angular momentum of each particle about the pin is conserved separately** if no other external torque acts.\n\n- **Tension forces:**\n\n  - Do no work (massless rope, no friction).\n\n  - Do not change total mechanical energy.\n\n- **Energy:**\n\n  - The plane is smooth; no friction or energy losses.\n\n  - Total kinetic energy is conserved.\n\n- **Relationship between particles:**\n\n  - Rope length constraint: \\( r_1 + r_2 = 4a \\).\n\n- **Initial angular momentum:**\n\n  - At encounter with pin, particles have linear velocity \\( v \\) perpendicular to the line connecting particles and pin.\n\n  - Initial angular momenta about the pin result from linear momenta \\( m \\vec{v} \\) times distance \\( r_i \\).\n\n- **Summary:**\n\n  - Both particles conserve angular momentum about the pin **individually** because each particle’s tension force is radial.\n\n  - Total mechanical energy is conserved.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Build Equations\n\n1. **Constraint:**\n\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = 4a.\n\\]\n\n2. **Angular momentum conservation of each particle about pin:**\n\n\\[\nL_1 = m r_1 v_1^{\\perp} = \\text{constant},\n\\]\n\\[\nL_2 = m r_2 v_2^{\\perp} = \\text{constant},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( v_i^{\\perp} \\) is the particle velocity component perpendicular to \\( \\vec{r_i} \\).\n\nAt initial moment (just when pin encountered):\n\n- Particle 1:\n\n\\[\nr_1 = a, \\quad v_1^{\\perp} = v.\n\\]\n\n\\[\nL_1 = m a v.\n\\]\n\n- Particle 2:\n\n\\[\nr_2 = 3a, \\quad v_2^{\\perp} = v,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nL_2 = m \\cdot 3a \\cdot v = 3 m a v.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, angular momenta are conserved:\n\n\\[\nm r_1 v_1^{\\perp} =  m a v \\implies v_1^{\\perp} = \\frac{a v}{r_1},\n\\]\n\\[\nm r_2 v_2^{\\perp} = 3 m a v \\implies v_2^{\\perp} = \\frac{3 a v}{r_2}.\n\\]\n\n3. **Energy conservation:**\n\nInitial total kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2}m v^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}m v^{2} = m v^{2}.\n\\]\n\nAt any time later:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_1^{\\perp})^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} m (v_2^{\\perp})^{2}.\n\\]\n\nPlugging \\( v_i^{\\perp} \\) in terms of \\( r_i \\):\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\frac{a v}{r_1}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\frac{3 a v}{r_2}\\right)^2 \n= \\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} a^{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1^{2}} + \\frac{9}{r_2^{2}} \\right).\n\\]\n\nBut total kinetic energy is constant \\( m v^{2} \\), so:\n\n\\[\nm v^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} a^{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1^{2}} + \\frac{9}{r_2^{2}} \\right),\n\\]\nor\n\n\\[\n2 = a^{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1^{2}} + \\frac{9}{r_2^{2}} \\right).\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( r_2 = 4a - r_1 \\), rewrite:\n\n\\[\n2 = a^{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1^{2}} + \\frac{9}{(4a - r_1)^{2}} \\right).\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( a^{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{a^{2}} = \\frac{1}{r_1^{2}} + \\frac{9}{(4a - r_1)^{2}}.\n\\]\n\nBut \\( r_1 \\) and \\( 4a - r_1 \\) have dimension of length.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Calculate Equations\n\nRewrite the energy conservation relation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{a^2} = \\frac{1}{r_1^2} + \\frac{9}{(4a - r_1)^2}.\n\\]\n\nLet:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{r_1}{a},\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{a^{2}} = \\frac{1}{a^{2} x^{2}} + \\frac{9}{a^{2} (4 - x)^{2}}.\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( a^{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{1}{x^{2}} + \\frac{9}{(4 - x)^{2}}.\n\\]\n\nOur problem reduces to solving for \\( x \\) in:\n\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{1}{x^{2}} + \\frac{9}{(4 - x)^{2}}.\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^{2}} + \\frac{9}{(4 - x)^{2}} = 2.\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by \\( x^{2} (4 - x)^{2} \\) (non-zero for \\( x \\in (0,4) \\)):\n\n\\[\n(4 - x)^2 + 9 x^{2} = 2 x^{2} (4 - x)^2.\n\\]\n\nExpand left side:\n\n\\[\n(4 - x)^2 + 9 x^{2} = (16 - 8x + x^{2}) + 9 x^{2} = 16 - 8x + 10 x^{2}.\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n2 x^{2} (4 - x)^2 = 2 x^{2} (16 - 8x + x^{2}) = 2 x^{2} (16 - 8x + x^{2}).\n\\]\n\nPutting all together:\n\n\\[\n16 - 8x + 10 x^{2} = 2 x^{2} (16 - 8x + x^{2}).\n\\]\n\nExpand right side:\n\n\\[\n16 - 8x + 10 x^{2} = 32 x^{2} - 16 x^{3} + 2 x^{4}.\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n0 = 32 x^{2} - 16 x^{3} + 2 x^{4} - 16 + 8 x - 10 x^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n0 = (32 x^{2} - 10 x^{2}) - 16 x^{3} + 2 x^{4} + 8 x - 16,\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 22 x^{2} - 16 x^{3} + 2 x^{4} + 8 x - 16.\n\\]\n\nRewrite:\n\n\\[\n2 x^{4} - 16 x^{3} + 22 x^{2} + 8 x - 16 = 0.\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to simplify coefficients:\n\n\\[\nx^{4} - 8 x^{3} + 11 x^{2} + 4 x - 8 = 0.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nWe now want the value of \\( x \\in (0,4) \\) satisfying the quartic:\n\n\\[\nx^{4} - 8 x^{3} + 11 x^{2} + 4 x - 8 = 0.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Trying to find roots:**\n\n- Try \\( x=1 \\):\n\n\\[\n1 - 8 + 11 + 4 - 8 = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\n(1 - 8) = -7, (-7 + 11) = 4, (4 + 4) = 8, 8 - 8 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( x=1 \\) is a root.\n\nDivide polynomial by \\( (x-1) \\):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -8 | 11 | 4 | -8\n\nBring down 1:\n\n- Multiply 1 by 1 =1;
